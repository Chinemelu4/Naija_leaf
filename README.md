# Naija_leaf

## Problem
A manufacturing industry want to mechanically improve their production process, they process some specific type of leaves for different products they make. Since the leaves are mixed up in the storage and cleaning units, seperating the leaves into the different types is done manually before processing.

## Solution
I used CNN to build a model to be able to adequately classify the difeerent leaves above human performance level.
